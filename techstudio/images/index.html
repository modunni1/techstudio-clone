                    Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get <br>
                 in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really <br>

                   fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were <br>

                     programming language – JavaScript. You’ll have built several full-stack applications <br>
                      of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development <br>
                     environment.
